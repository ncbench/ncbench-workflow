Welcome to the results of NCBench, the variant calling benchmarking initiative of `the german NGS competence network (NGS-CN) <https://ngs-kn.de>`_.
NCBench consists of a reproducible `Snakemake <https://snakemake.github.io>`_ workflow that is hosted in a `Github repository <https://github.com/ncbench/ncbench-workflow>`_.
The workflow can be provided with `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org>`_ depositions of variant callsets for various benchmark datasets (`GIAB <https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/genome-bottle>`_, `chm-eval <https://github.com/lh3/CHM-eval>`_), which it automatically analyses against the respective benchmark datasets using `Github Actions <https://github.com/features/actions>`_.
The results are shown in this Snakemake report.

For checking precision/recall as well as false positives and negatives of all so-far provided callsets, please navigate the menu on the left.

For contributing your own callsets, please check out the instructions at `https://github.com/ncbench/ncbench-workflow`_.
